# EF-dist
This project uses data from the tor-cluster project to build a model to predict the distribution of tornadoes in an outbreak by EF rating. The tor-cluster project is done in collaboration with Zoe Schroder. The modeling approach was inspired by Lecture 14 of Richard McElreath https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019 and the code uses his **rethinking** package.
